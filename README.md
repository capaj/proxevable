# proxevable

experimental object change tracker based on ES6 proxies, api shadows [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)

Proxies might be a future of mobx-for example observation on arrays is more reliable-see [this sample](https://github.com/capaj/proxevable/blob/master/sample/array-observing.js).
The performance is slightly worse, but hopefully it can be optimized further.
