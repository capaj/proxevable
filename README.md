# proxevable

performant object change tracker based on ES6 proxies, api shadows [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)

Why would you choose this over MobX? If you can rely on ES6 Proxies, then proxevable is the right choice. [Even Michael Westrate would like to move to proxies](https://hashnode.com/ama/with-mobx-cinspo7i500vyxs53buh8ebls#cio1rbi0y02rnni53a0vfduu9).

For example observation on arrays is more reliable-see [this sample](https://github.com/capaj/proxevable/blob/master/sample/array-observing.js).
